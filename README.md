# fantasyCombat

A text-based combat game for two players. First, each player chooses a character with unique stats and abilities. Afterwards, each player automotically rolls a die which determines the attack and defense values, and damage is dealt accordingly. When a character's hit pointers are less than or equal to 0, the game ends and displays the winner.
